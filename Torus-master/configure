echo The makefile assumes that the directory libebf_c_cpp-0.0.3 has been 
echo placed next to the Torus directory, and that it has been installed in that 
echo directory too. I.e. EBF has been installed with the commands:
echo
echo ./configure --prefix=\$PWD
echo make
echo make install
echo
echo If you want to install it anywhere else, you can change the bits of the
echo makefile that refer to EBF to point to where you\'ve installed it.

echo If that\'s done, just run make
